# Prerequisites

This tutorial uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) as a build tool. Before you can run this project, you will need to:   

### 1. Have `Node.js` installed in your computer
First check whether it is installed or not by running in your terminal:
```
node -v
```
  - If Node.js is installed, this command will return the version number of Node.js that is installed on your system. 
  - If Node.js is not installed, the command will not be recognized, and you'll likely see an error message indicating that the command is not found. You can find instructions on [how to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the official website. 

### 2. Download the latest version of `npm` on the command line
Same as before, you can first check if `npm` is installed by typing in the terminal:
```
npm -v
```
- This command will return the version number of npm if it is installed on your system
- If you get an error indicating that the 'npm' command is not found, you can install `npm` by running the following command:
```
npm install -g npm
```
Re-run the previous command to check that it is now working:
```
npm -v
```
