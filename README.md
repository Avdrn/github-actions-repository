# CodeWomen workshop - Automate your deployment process with Github Actions

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a deployment pipeline with Github Actions from scratch, and help you grasp continuous integration and continuous delivery concepts (CI/CD) practically.

Each lab introduces a new CI/CD concept and adds a new step to the pipeline. The initial labs will help you understand the tools and how to create a pipeline using Github Actions. By completing all the labs, you'll have a fully functional pipeline and a strong foundation in applying CI/CD principles to your projects.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 

## Who is it for?

This tutorial is designed for programming students and junior developers or beginners in CI/CD, who want to learn by doing and understand continuous delivery concepts and pipeline automation through hands-on practice.    
You don't need to have any previous experience in CI/CD but basic knowledge of Github commands is recommended.

## About the application

The **XXX** application is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-Application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and tested with React Testing Library.


### Useful commands to build and run the application

| Description                                               | Command         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Installs all the dependencies listed in package.json      | `npm install`   |
| Builds the app for production to the `build` folder       | `npm run build` |
| Starts the app by deploy locally the app in dev mode      | `npm start`     |
| Runs the tests for the application                        | `npm test`      |
| Lint the Code with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)          | `npm run lint`  |

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. Anything you need for this workshop is contained within this repository - so the first thing you need to do is get a copy of it! If you are new to Github, you can learn how to **fork** it and **clone** it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)
2. Make sure you start by the [prerequisites section](docs/00-prerequisites.md) to make sure that you have everything we need installed
3. Run and build the React application following the steps in the [local development lab](docs/01-local-development.md)
4. Create your first pipeline and run your first github action
